Performance is a topic that is often talked about at conferences and in articles about
best practices â€“ but the reality of day-to-day development often looks quite different:


There is that bug that breaks production, that branding change that somebody announced
publicly before talking to the development team, or simply the next feature that management
demands to be implemented. In short: Aspirations are nice, but if management does not agree 
about the priorities they will fall by the wayside.


In the case of Performance this is a particular tragedy in my opinion because I think that
_**a focus on performance turns decent apps into great ones.**_


So in this article I want to explain why I hold this opinion and hopefully provide some
material to convince you and your boss to care about performance as much as <span class="subtle">(I think)</span> you should.
